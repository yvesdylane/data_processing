🚢 LAB 3 : Titanic Data Processing & Modeling 🧑‍💻

Welcome to the Titanic Data Preprocessing & Modeling project! 🌊 
This project showcases how to preprocess data, handle missing values, outliers, feature engineering, and build models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest! 🔥


🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

This project is built using Python 🐍 and the following libraries:


Pandas 🐼: For data manipulation.

NumPy 🔢: For numerical operations.

Matplotlib 📊 & Seaborn 🎨: For visualizations.

Scikit-learn 🤖: For machine learning and model evaluation.


🔍 Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to preprocess the Titanic dataset and build models to predict passenger survival 🛳️. 
Here's a quick breakdown of the steps taken:


Data Collection 📦


Used the Titanic dataset from seaborn 🎯

Data Cleaning 🧹


Handle missing values, outliers, and invalid data 🚮

Outliers Handling 🚫


Capped the extreme values in age and fare columns ✂️

Normalization 📐


Scaled the numerical features using Min-Max scaling or Z-score normalization 🎚️

Feature Engineering 🛠️


Created new features like family_size and extracted title from names 📛

Feature Selection 📑


Selected important features using correlation and feature importance analysis 🔍


Model Building 🧑‍🔬

Built Logistic Regression & Random Forest models for classification 🤖

📊 Results

After training our models, here's what we found:


Logistic Regression Results 🚀

Accuracy: 0.79

Precision: 0.72

Recall: 0.72

F1 Score: 0.72


Random Forest Results 🌲

Accuracy: 0.78

Precision: 0.74

Recall: 0.65

F1 Score: 0.69

👀 The Logistic Regression model performed slightly better in terms of recall, while Random Forest had higher precision.


🤔 Why Titanic Dataset?

The Titanic dataset is famous for demonstrating basic machine learning tasks such as classification 📚. 
It's easy to understand yet provides a challenging problem with both categorical and numerical data 🧠.


🔥 Features of this Project
